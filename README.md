I started this repo on 05/15/2004. Maria sent me an excel wrkbk with a list of account names and had highlighted in red what she wanted the names modified to. I wrote a simple JS code that seems to work perfectly. I emailed Maria the results and asked her to let me know if it was what she wanted, and I would start working on the VBA code.

The js file is called shorten_acct_names.js

05/16/24 Sent Maria VBA code that would ask for column input. (Afterwards, she said she wouldn't need the input column. I can change it later if needed.)
